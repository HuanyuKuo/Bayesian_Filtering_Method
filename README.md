# Bayesian Filtering Method
**A Python program that applies Bayesian filtering method (BFM) to estimate the selection-coefficient from barcode-count data for barcode-lineage-tracking (BLT) experiment.**

The central concept of this method is the Bayesian probability distribution on the lineage's selection-coefficient, which is updated one data point at a time (prior -> posterior). At each time step, global parameters (experimental noise & populationâ€™s mean selection-coefficient) are estimated based on the current knowledge of individual lineages. All individual lineages are classified into adaptive or neutral class. This Bayesian method estimates the selection coefficient, for single lineage, from the mean of posterior distribution of individual adpative lineage. 

* Before you run the code, check **System Request** and **Data Setting**. 
* Execute the program 
  ```sh
  python3 main.py 
  ```
* Example of input barcode-data "./input/Data_BarcodeCount_simuMEE_20220213.txt", with running results under "./output/"
* A simulation program is provided as a data generator for barcode-lineage-tracking. You could play with it and use simulation data to test the BFM code. 
* This project aims to (1) identify adpative barcode (2) estimate the selection coefficient for each adaptive lineaege (3) infer the trajectory of mean-fitness (i.e. population mean of selection coefficient) (4) estimate the systematic noise in BLT experiment.

## System Request
1. Python version > 3.6
2. Libraries (Run a test code to check libraries)
   ```sh
   python3 test_library.py
   ```
    my print out is: Python version 3.8.8 (default, Apr 13 2021, 15:08:03) [MSC v.1916 64 bit (AMD64)]
    Library version
    numpy 1.20.1
    scipy 1.6.2
    matplotlib 3.3.4
    json 2.0.9
    pickle 4.0
    noisyopt 0.2.2
    pystan 2.19.1.1
   
3. This program can use multi-processing to speed up the MCMC calculations. A multi CPU-core environment is recommended. 
## Data Setting
1. Parameters (Open "./main_scripts/myConstant.py". Edit **NUMBER_OF_PROCESSES** and **EXPERIMENTAL PARAMETERS** for your case.)
2. Input data (Save your barcode-count data as a txt file under "./input/", with barcodes=row and time-point=column)
3. Test (Edit **datafilename** in "./main_scripts/myReadfile.py" as your input file name. Then run code to test the file reading.)
    ```sh
    python3 myReadfile.py
    ```
## Run Bayesian Filtering Method
1. Open "./main_scripts/main.py". Edit **datafilename** & **case_name** for your case.
2. Run BFM in a command window. 
    ```sh
    python3 main.py
    ```
3. (Optional) Run "./main_scripts/plot_result.py" to output results or make plots.

## Debug
1. Most library are common package except of noisyopt and pystan. Both of them are on PyPI, to install:
    ```sh
    pip3 install --user noisyopt
    ```
2. If you get error message about pickle protocol (model_load = pickle.load(pickle_file) ValueError: unsupported pickle protocol: 5), it's because your pickle version is different to my pickle version when I use pickle for model code. To solve this bug,
